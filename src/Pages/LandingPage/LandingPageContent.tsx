        My motivation for developing Spito stemmed from the recognition of Linux's strengths, such as privacy and performance, coupled with the desire to address its complexity.

          I saw an opportunity to enhance Linux by introducing simplicity through spito.

        This passion inspired me to participate in the spito project which
